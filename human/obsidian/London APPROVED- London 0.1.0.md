**APPROVED · IMPLEMENTATION SPECIFICATION · London 0.1.0**

## Current direction: Move accounting, one streaming-node role

The product owner has approved simplifying London to a player, small coordinator, private S3 audio origin, streaming nodes and Move-owned accounting/payout state. Any eligible artist or other participant can operate the same streaming-node software. A real node-to-node cache transfer remains part of the pilot.

**Architecture revision in progress.** This direction supersedes the previous RocksDB-first priority and hash-only commitment contract. The detailed chapters below still describe that preceding revision and are not yet a consistent implementation handoff for the new design. Do not build the old ledger or commitment-only settlement path from them.

Start with the [Move storage spike](https://github.com/porto-labs-xyz/docs/blob/main/research/london-move-storage/README.md): Table and BigOrderedMap candidates, bounded accounting, Mainnet limits, local collection tests and explicit remaining benchmark gates. Collection selection is a research recommendation, not a production-scale result. The next specification revision must align accounting, privacy, USDC transfers, APIs and acceptance tests before implementation.

London still excludes PRT, a custom chain and an independent attestor network. Approval of the direction is not deployment, security clearance or observed real payouts.

## Previous specification, pending revision

The chapter structure below is retained for the coordinated rewrite. Its earlier approval and validation records describe the previous specification, not completed validation of the revised architecture.

## Read by responsibility

| Reader | Start here | Then implement against |
|---|---|---|
| Product / human overview | Scope, executive architecture, journeys, pilot | Launch inputs and measured success boundaries |
| Backend | Architecture, streaming, accounting, data model | API, artifact schemas, fixtures and acceptance cases |
| Node / infrastructure | Streaming, node package, security, operations | Peer authorisation, durability and failure tests |
| Frontend | Journeys and human-facing states | OpenAPI and browser acceptance matrix |
| Move / verifier | Commitment module and wire formats | Golden fixtures, append invariants and proof verdicts |
| Finance / legal / security | Funding, rights, trust and required launch inputs | Production profile and G5 sign-offs |
| Any implementing agent | Implementation plan and scope exclusions | W0-W7 and A01-A48 traceability |

## Machine-readable handoff

- [Ledger schemas](ledger-schemas.json): command envelope, journal and portable checkpoint.
- [Ledger fixtures](ledger-fixtures.json): canonical hashes and journal chaining examples.
- [OpenAPI](openapi.json): complete coordinator/node HTTP surface and schemas.
- [Artifact schemas](artifact-schemas.json): evidence, accounting, statements, indexes, payment journals and corrections.
- [Release profile schema](release-profile.schema.json): mandatory production inputs, no invented commercial defaults.
- [Fixtures](fixtures.json): synthetic canonical hash and allocation vectors.
- [Source manifest](source-manifest.json): pinned canonical source evidence.

Canonical source directory is `porto/docs/london-0.1.0/`. The existing Docusaurus build reads it directly and publishes this section under `/london-0.1.0/overview`. Documentation and schema validation do not establish application security, Mainnet deployment or successful pilot results.
