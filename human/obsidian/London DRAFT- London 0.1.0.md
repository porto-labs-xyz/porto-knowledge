**DRAFT · PROPOSED · IMPLEMENTATION SPECIFICATION**

London 0.1.0 specifies a proposed real-money music MVP on Aptos Mainnet: GBP subscriptions, Porto-owned treasury conversion, native USDC settlement, private origin storage, permissioned delivery operators and Porto-trusted attestation. It launches no PRT, Porto L1, bridge or Porto validator network.

> Porto operates a music delivery and settlement network. Initial real-money settlement uses proven Mainnet infrastructure while Porto builds toward its own app-chain.

This is proposed positioning, not proof of approval or launch. The files are implementation and review artefacts only. All production-blocking decisions remain explicit; no provider agreement, licence, audit, deployment or payment is established.

[OpenAPI contract](./openapi.json) defines endpoint schemas and examples; [source manifest](./source-manifest.json) pins reviewed sources. Both are stored next to these documents. The [validation report](24-validation-and-impact.md) records documentation checks and their proof boundaries.
