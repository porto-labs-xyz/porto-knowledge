**DRAFT · PROPOSED · IMPLEMENTATION SPECIFICATION**

## Current source evidence

Reviewed 22 September 2026. Source hashes below pin local file bytes, with repository HEAD for navigation. A commit link describes that repository revision; where local bytes differ, the SHA-256 is the exact review identity. Existing sources are draft specifications, not implementation evidence. London algorithms and policy defaults are new proposals unless explicitly labelled CURRENT SOURCE. No historical marketing figures are adopted as verified current facts.

## Engineering and orientation sources

`CURRENT SOURCE`: `porto-core/CLAUDE.md`, exact sections “Porto Labs Fork”, “What stays (do not remove or gut)”, “Naming and rebrand policy”, and “Current phase”, was read only because the brief explicitly requested it. It describes fork engineering, not London deployment. Private instructions are not reproduced or materialised in the public documentation graph.

Orientation consulted: `PORTO_AGENT_INSTRUCTIONS.md`, `PORTO_CONTEXT.md`, `design/design-notes.md`, docs README/config/sidebar, local semantic graph, and organisation graph search/traversal for PIP-4 and the whitepaper. The graph routes to evidence; INFERRED links do not ratify architecture. No approved presentation/design decision changed, so design notes require no new decision entry.

No roadmap PDF was supplied. The attached text brief is requirements input, not evidence of an approved roadmap, licence, provider agreement or deployment.

## External technical references

These references support only the narrow technical facts identified; they are not endorsement or legal/financial advice. Reverify platform details before implementation.

- [Aptos sponsored transactions](https://aptos.dev/build/guides/sponsored-transactions): fee-payer capability reference, not a deployed Porto sponsor.
